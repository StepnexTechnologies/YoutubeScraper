Sure he isn't the over the top guy I used to love, but he's still the same guy from halfway across the world making me smile every day. After all his hard work he's finally gotten the retirement he deserves. It makes me think about how far I've come. While he's living his dream, I've been just sitting idly, my middle school and highschool days passing by. I graduate next year and I'm absolutely terrified. I've never really thought about what I wanted to do, which sure a lot of people my age don't, but still. Seeing Felix like this makes me want to do things I've always wanted to do. I want to strive to do things I'm pretty sure are impossible, but I'll try my best. It's ten months till graduation. No more sleeping in past noon, no more moping around in my room all day.
