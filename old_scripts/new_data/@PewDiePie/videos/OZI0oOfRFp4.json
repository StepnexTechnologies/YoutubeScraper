Bjorn is such a wonderful toddler, and how hands on you and Marzia are is so inspiring! I'm learning a lot as a homemaker from Marzia (I wish she would go back to vlogging as a mom! but understandable if not). Also, THE DOGS! Omg, you guys have come to become quite the wolf pack - please do a vlog for each dog, like a day in the life of Eggy <3",
