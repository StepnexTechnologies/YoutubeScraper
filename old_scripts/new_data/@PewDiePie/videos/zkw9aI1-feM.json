I'm an actor, worked on many movies (you can back this up by searching my name Samuel Victor) & I'm currently in training to star in a pretty big superhero movie being announced at London Film and Comic Con in July. Its not a Marvel or DC property but based on an indie comic, but many people who work on Marvel and DC movies are working on it and helped develop and fund it.\n\nPart of this was I was moved to a major studio owned property and assigned a dietician/nutritionalist and personal trainer (both of whom have worked with some of the major stars) and work with them (or at least report to them) every day. The diet is extremely strict and gruelling. The workout regime is crazy, basically several hours everyday (different muscle groups each day so they have time to recover).\n\nAbout once every couple of months, I'm offered the opportunity on company money to have a doctor test my testosterone levels, and decide that my \"levels are low\", and prescribe me some - injecting prescribed testosterone is basically steroids by a legal name and with plausible deniability - \"no man I don't take steroids! I had a hormone imbalance and the doctor prescribed this!\". Thats the deal here. So far, I've said no, and that's been accepted fine - they aren't forcing me to juice up, just letting me know the option is there if I want faster and more dramatic results. But I'm always told its an option that's there if I want it, and that many other actors use them. \"No shame in it, as you still have to work incredibly hard, and its safe because we are constantly monitoring your bloods, heart etc!\".\n\nI definitely use the EMS machines (the \"electrocuting yourself\" things that Felix mentioned) both during and after certain workouts, and they do work well to increase endurance and muscle tone - don't be fooled into thinking they burn fat though, they won't give you a six pack if you are over 14% body fat, just make your stomach stronger under the fat! lol They aren't a shortcut if you don't work out as well, they just improve the aesthetics by toning and tightening if you already have a ripped physique. I can tell you they aren't exactly pleasant to use though.\n\nAlso, for the record, all tight lycra style supersuits (Spider-Man, Super Man etc) have muscle shaped padding inside them. Even the hyper jacked celebs use them cos otherwise that skin tight compression makes you look super skinny, similar to women wearing spanx underwear! The real heavy working out is done not for the supersuit stuff, but for the scenes where you're just in a tight tshirt, or have to have your shirt off for \"plot reasons\" ;)\n\nI recently started a small podcast exposing some of the more shady things that I've been witness to in certain Hollywood circles. Its getting me in trouble and losing some jobs, but if this superhero movie suddenly blows me up and makes me famous I want it to be clear that I'm a good person on the right side of history.
