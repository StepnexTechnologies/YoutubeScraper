If you want better core strengthening for sweet Bjorn while he sits, try the upseat! It puts the hips and spine in correct alignment and engages the trunk while sitting.

I think in the states they had to redesign because a lot of babies were getting hip problems with it. The newer model bumbo is safer, but your seat looks like the older version and I\u2019m not sure how other countries are regulating these baby seats. It\u2019s not bad if used infrequently, but I always recommend the upseat vs the bumbo.
