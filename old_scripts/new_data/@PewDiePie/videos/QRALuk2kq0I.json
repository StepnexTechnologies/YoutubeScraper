Two years back I was bulky & fat. It had a toll on my confidence. I didn't like how I looked and was progressively getting worse.\n\nYour workout video inspired me to start focusing on my health. I've been working out to some degree for the last 2-3 years and I'm at a much better spot. I'm not ripped or anything but I got rid of the fat and am more confident than I ever was. \n\nYouTube was always a source of entertainment for me but your video had a huge impact on my life. So, thank you pews. I really appreciate it.
