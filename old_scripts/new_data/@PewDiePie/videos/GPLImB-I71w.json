It was a random YouTube recommendation, I don't watch your content with any regularity at all, I hadn't seen any of the previous videos of your journey, but this was amazing. As a kid I thought art was cool, but was \"too cool\" for it, being labeled the math and science kid. Then later in life when I grew up enough to realize how silly that was it felt too late to get into art, I tried it briefly - VERY briefly - and hated what I drew so I gave up on it, saying I couldn't do it, I was too old, I didn't have the motor skills, and any other excuse I could think of. I saw this video a three weeks ago now, and it inspired me to try again. But to actually give it a shot, not half-ass it, to not let myself run away because it was tough or I wasn't happy. To sit down and dedicate some real time and effort into learning, to watch YouTube tutorials and just actually sketch for hours.\n\nAnd in two weeks I can proudly say I suck, miserably, but I suck noticeably less than when I started, and I feel like I have an actual direction. I can look at my stuff and say \"Wow, that's awful, I really got the proportions wrong, I really need to work on my line work, I really need to lower the eyes\". I can see where I'm going wrong, and I'm starting to learn how to actually learn how to draw, how to look at what people draw and see how I'd go about applying that myself. Where before I'd see something someone drew and think \"Wow, that looks so nice, I could never do that in my life\" now I think \"Wow, look at how they did that, look at the shape of the face, the perspective, how it's posed - how would I go about doing that? Where would I start? What are the proportions they used?\"\n\nIt's been super fun, and it's a lifelong regret I've managed to rectify, specifically thanks to the push from this video. The idea that I could try something just for fun, that it didn't have to be in furtherance of work or employment, that it doesn't ever have to be for some grand purpose, is so foreign to me it was super difficult to take that first step.
