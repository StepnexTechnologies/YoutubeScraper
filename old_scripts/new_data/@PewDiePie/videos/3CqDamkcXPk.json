When people will finally understand that if you travel to some other country, you are a guest, you should respect the local culture and customs. I fully agree with the restrictions imposed by Japanese authorities, I even think they should be more strict with the police and fines. Seriously, if you want to see Mt Fuji, a temple, anything else, just be grateful for this opportunity and do NOT act as if you were ENTITLED to do so! Exactly this attitude pisses me off so much. Japanese can restrict access to areas, they can build fences, they can give fines and (hopefully) put to jail, because it it their home, their country and they set the rules - not some stupid, obnoxious tourists!

Japan is being absolutely ruined by foreign non-resident YouTubers. Clickbaiters, annoying little turds running around causing a disturbance and not respecting etiquette, and even those who think they're helping but as a result create problems for the very groups they are trying to help all ruin the travel experience. \n\nFor example, I'm doing a lot of retro game hunting here and it was clear at some point the prices were very good, and  there were a lot of smaller shops that are real hidden gems which offer superb prices as well as a variety of harder to find items. However, as I was making my way through various shops, I found a myriad of youtubers who track each shop's stock and upload it as videos. Some of them find some deals, but the second they find a deal and choose not to purchase said deal, someone goes to scoop everything they found up. Now, prices are sky high at even more remote and smaller shops. Even the local shops in my neighborhood have people. I respect what they do for their communities, but they absolutely ruin any fun of approaching a shop and being surprised by a cool inventory. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the prices in many cases will adjust due to the weak yen needing to change, so some of it makes sense, but just that alone doesn't add up for why some prices are so high at smaller shops. This means game the spotting they do clearly pushes demand up for some items as tourists scoop them up and remove them from a reselling pool at an accelerated rate due to people being more easily informed. As a result, prices inflate more quickly and make stuff less accessible.\n\nOverall, I have nothing against the people from these game hunting channels. Each person I met was very nice, and had a passion for what they were doing. I just wish it wouldn't have the effect it does on the market, and I also wish they'd do more content about the games  themselves instead of ruining cool spots with good prices. With that, they're much better than the people running through tourist spots with camera rigs shoving it in everyone's faces.", "commenter_channel_name": "@williamhess3873", "likes": 65, "date": "7 months ago", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 13:23:06.509972", "replies_count": null, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "This is so crazy that you filmed this film right now.
