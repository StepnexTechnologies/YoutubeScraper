But even with that mentality I completely agree with pewds about watches, I can use my phone, but a watch is so nice and it doesn't loose its battery. Plus I'm so used to having a watch so it's kind of comforting to feel it on my wrist. My watch is a casio watch, they're great they make watches of almost the same quality as premium watches but they're so cheap. It cost me $10, I've had it for years and I've never noticed it get off by even a second, and it says it has a 10 year battery life, I haven't had it for 10 years yet but so far it's lasted for years without issues. It also is water resistant, in my experience essentially waterproof because I can shower, bathe, and swim with it, and it can handle depths up to some distance, I forgot how far but it's deeper than I can handle so essentially I can swim as deep as I want with it. And it also shows the day of the month as well as the time, so I can easily keep track of that, which is actually useful because it takes a few steps on my phone to see the date as opposed to my watch, just look at the number. I especially love that bc I have a terrible memory and never keep track of what day it is. I just wish that it had a bit more sophisticated of a way of telling the date so I didn't have to reset it every month that doesn't have 31 days, since the way it works is that it just has a cycle from 1 to 31, so on any months with fewer days I have to set it to the first manually, and I also wish it had the day of the week because I forget that too. But I got all the features I do have for a durable watch which will supposedly last 10 years, all for $10.
