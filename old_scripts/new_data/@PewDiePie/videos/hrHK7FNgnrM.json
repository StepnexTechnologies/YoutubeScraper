It's really beautiful to see.\n\nI hope he can stick to these new hobbies/interests over the years, as they'll deepen the quality of his life immensely. \n\nSo, thank you sincerely, Felix.

He really saw the beauty in Japan\u2019s culture and people before and during the war.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with his opinions mind, but I do also understand why he felt the way he did about postwar Japan. It\u2019s a complex and difficult topic to discuss that\u2019s far more nuanced than pure ethnocentrism.
