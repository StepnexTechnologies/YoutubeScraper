I still remember meeting Tatiana at that restaurant when I was a kid (after they had filmed and aired the episode of course). It\u2019s honestly surreal seeing Felix do a video on this episode. I\u2019ll ask my dad to see what he remembers and I will share it with you guys. Again, this was years ago lol\n\n(edit/update 1) To clarify further,\nmy dad was the replacement for the guy who got fired at \nThe chef they talked about finding at  ended up being my dad\n\n(edit/update 2) My dad worked at Charlie\u2019s until they eventually closed 8 months or so after they had filmed the episode (financial reasons I think, the restaurant/chef industry is rough believe it or not). During his time there me, my little brother, and my mom went there and we met Tatiana in person, we went there a few times and she would always talk with us whenever she could, at least until my dad was laid off. The last time we EVER interacted with Tatiana was when my parents sold our old couch to her and that was the last I ever heard about her. She was actually rather friendly and polite in person from what I remember. My dad might still be in contact with her, but I am not sure.\n\n(edit/update 3) Thankfully this story has a happy ending, after Charlie's, my dad was able to put his experience there on his resume, which landed him a bunch of other job opportunities. However me and my family eventually grew sick of California, so we moved across the country half a year ago. We now live in New Hampshire, and he's currently working as the executive chef at a super nice seafood restaurant. He loves his job and couldn't ask for anything else :)", "commenter_channel_name": "@Alleriian", "likes": 14000, "date": "2 years ago (edited)", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 13:59:22.692685", "replies_count": null, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "I love that she warned Gordon about the lasagna, literally gave \"reduce your expectations to zero\"", "commenter_channel_name": "@abiglug", "likes": 7000, "date": "2 years ago", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 13:59:22.729326", "replies_count": null, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "Lmao, her trying to hug the chef with a crying face, immediately after firing him has big Michael Scott energy.", "commenter_channel_name": "@DanielleVlog365", "likes": 2000, "date": "2 years ago", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 13:59:22.772136", "replies_count": null, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "21:36 Get this\n\nAn Italian Restaurant, Owned by an American, Who has a Chef that\u2019s Mexican, That managed to cook Chinese Food instead of Italian Food", "commenter_channel_name": "@darklinggolem", "likes": 748, "date": "1 year ago", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 13:59:22.808772", "replies_count": null, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "I love how he goes all in on the owners and chefs but always stays respectful towards the waiters", "commenter_channel_name": "@a.b5301", "likes": 4000, "date": "2 years ago", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 13:59:22.846215", "replies_count": null, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "Gordon has the capacity to absolutely destroy a person with his words\n\nHowever, as soon as he says \u201cThankyou, my darling\u201d to the waitress- it is SO endearing", "commenter_channel_name": "@JulietteHelene", "likes": 6000, "date": "2 years ago", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 13:59:22.882012", "replies_count": null, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "if Marzia allows it, i'd actually love to see her reactions to these italian restaurants on kitchen nightmares", "commenter_channel_name": "@jillius", "likes": 44000, "date": "2 years ago", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 13:59:22.918717", "replies_count": null, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "That waitress is amazing.
