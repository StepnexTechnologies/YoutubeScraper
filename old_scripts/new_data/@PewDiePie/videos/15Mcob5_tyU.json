I feel like it's worth mentioning that this was like a HUGE debate in philosophy even before Socrates showed up... A bunch of sophists (who got paid to teach philosophy rather than just spread it around as they went about their day like Socrates) debated what everything was made up of (trying to figure out what they called 'arche') and you got a wild amount of theories on this, not just atoms... Some believed everything was fire, or water, or earth, or air, or love and strife (I think some poet suggested), or number (as the Pythagoreans believed, they were followers of Pythagoras who worshipped numbers and hated the idea of irrational numbers aka numbers involving decimals... Very interesting...), or there was even Parmenides arguing that everything IS (as in he believed that everything is as it is because nothing changes and time isn't real, I'd suggest you refer to Zeno's Paradoxes to make sense of this position... The answers involve mathematics that the Greeks didn't have...) \n\nYou did have the atomists though who did suggest that everything was made up of tiny things called atoms, HOWEVER, these atomists didn't really know how it worked... They didn't understand sub-atomic particles and stuff... A big objection to them was basically \"If everything is made up of these atoms, then what exists in the space between these atoms?\" and obviously if you just answered \"More atoms\" you'd run into a infinite problem of being asked \"What exists between those atoms?\" So they really didn't have much of an idea of how atoms worked but when it comes to arche they were the closest in finding the correct answer... Still, it can also be interesting to look into Zeno's Paradoxes or also Heraclitus' perspective IMO...\n\nONE THING I WILL SAY THOUGH (haven't watched this video so maybe it'll be covered) which is even more astounding than the atomists' conclusions I think... The Greeks also had a guy who used the pyramids and the Sun to fairly accurately determine that the Earth was spherical and they even approximated its size!!! (They were slightly off, but surprisingly close)... To be able to do that without satellite technology or even the technology to travel around much of the world seems impressive to me...

I want more!!\n\nAlso with regards to Epicurism I think it's delusional in a sense that it implies we have greater control over our happiness and makes an unrealistic ideal seem attainable. Life is about balance, and we can't control our emotions and not even our cognition the majority of the time. For example, considering PTSD causes involuntary reexperiencing symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares, etc. Which result in physical pain, adrenaline rush and so on, it is clearly unrealistic to say we can just logically think our way out of fears of uncertainties/difficulties in the future. They are reinforced by past experiences, for some to the point of being disabling.\n\nA better approach would be to unpick and disprove fears individually based on the context in which they appear and why.\n\nAlso think its quite presumptuous to assume that we cease to exist when we die. The body doesn't cease to exist, it changes form, we don't know for sure what happens to the mind as its intangible. Nothing starts and stops it simply changes form, so why would the mind be any different. And also these days we also know that a bunch of hormones are released which seem to cause painlessness, these are better ways to address fear of death. \n\nBut that fear will always be there because we live in uncertainty of what happens, there's evidence but its not deemed universally significant because its subjective. Hence we have a number of religions that have different ideas about the afterlife, its aim is to ease that fear of uncertainty. However when it comes to the concept of heaven, hell and purgatory it reintroduces fear of death in another way.", "commenter_channel_name": "@n0thersist3r", "likes": 56, "date": "3 years ago (edited)", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 14:51:39.848848", "replies_count": null, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "I really feel like this video came about at a fairly crucial time in my life where I actually have been asking myself these very questions and kind of at a loss for how to improve my situation meaningfully, as I'm not religious and didn't follow thru with university.
