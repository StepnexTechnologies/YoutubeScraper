Parents should be limiting how long their kids are playing games, and it's best to start when they are young so they know and understand limits and boundaries at a young age! Another thing parents can do is allowing their kids to play video games but sit with them and watch them play! Learning about what your child is excited about can be a huge bonding experience that parents are missing out on. The screen should never be like a baby sitter!", "commenter_channel_name": "@lipton87", "likes": 17, "date": "2 years ago", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 14:01:55.009616", "replies_count": 0, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u76ee\u306b\u6620\u308b\u65e5\u672c\u306f\u3042\u307e\u308a\u306b\u3082\u7f8e\u3057\u3044", "commenter_channel_name": "@NonNon-in9rw", "likes": 3, "date": "2 years ago", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 14:01:55.043347", "replies_count": 0, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "Im loving the vlogs plus its pewdiepie and japan just perfect", "commenter_channel_name": "@TokyoGhoulBest", "likes": 1, "date": "2 years ago", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 14:01:55.077352", "replies_count": 0, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "These videos give me so much joy.
