Also, you need to install proper recovery points made from certain mild steel for doing recovery like that - they are designed to take the kind of load like a full sized Toyota or land rover stuck in deep mud. You also will not lose your bumper again (lol). Lastly, I would say do not stand close to recovery rope when towing the car out from being stuck - they can snap and it will injure whoever is close by. Also, I would recommend getting a longer and stronger recovery rope (I presume this was your first time, so you did not have certain pieces of equipment). \n\nLastly, it is a good idea to deflate your tyres to a lower pressure, so that sharp stones and rocks do not cut the tyres and also it provides better traction since there is more surface area in contact with the ground. \n\nI loved the video!\n\nLove you pewds! <3", "commenter_channel_name": "@bjornarvidlagerkvistsandst4608", "likes": 212, "date": "2 years ago", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 14:03:42.652290", "replies_count": null, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "As a Aussie that love 4 wheel driving, this makes me so happy.
