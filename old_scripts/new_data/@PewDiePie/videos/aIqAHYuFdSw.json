After a couple of months a friend managed to send me most of my things, but there's still money for a whole semester on my japanese bank account I can't access from overseas and my residence card is now expired so I can't get in under the exceptions. It's not just that the borders have been closed for so long, it also feels like they've been trying to make things as difficult as possible. \n\nI of course had to cancel the second part of the exchange and missed a semester.

Everyone keeps asking me: \"so when are you going to Japan\" and at that point all I can say is: \"I wish I knew\". At this point it's ridiculous because I've waited that long that it would be bad to give up, but at the same time I can wait much longer as my life needs to go on.
