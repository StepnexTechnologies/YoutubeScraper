My advice would be to just start with anything which is better than your current state. Meaning if you are on bed or chair all day, start by walking in your house in breaks. Walk for 10 mins in your lawn or just do 5 pushups; do anything. The point that is if you do this, eventually, may be in a few weeks or few months you will get into a full routine workout.
