It\u2019s almost like onigiri(not as traditional but as common). I think it appears a lot in school set anime too.  Its basically stir fried sauce noodles between bread. It\u2019s high in calories but you can\u2019t resist eating it once in a while\u2026\n \u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\uff08Choco-balls\uff09- This is classic and veery famous.
