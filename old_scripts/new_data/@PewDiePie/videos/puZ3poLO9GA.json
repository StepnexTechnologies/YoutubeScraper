When will you realize that you are missing someone? It is when you feel so excited to see him or her again after being apart for quite some time. And maybe, when you feel uncomfortable when the thought of that person crosses your mind.\n\n                                               This person whom I misses so much is the one I have not seen for a month or so\u2014- \u201cmy boyfriend\u201d. I do not know if I can still call him that way. The last thing I remember is that when we argued about the very common thing about us\u2014my parents\u2019 hatred for him. My parents did not like him for me. The reason is that we are still young and we have o permanent jobs yet to create our own lives in the future. At this point, we are still finishing college. But nevertheless, we still try to keep in touch through all the barriers in our relationship; although lately, the barriers become worse. Whenever he calls me at home, my parents say that I am not around eventhough I just stayed there the whole day. Because of what happened, he started being cold and uneasy. He gets mad easily, gets annoyed easily, too, although there is nothing to be mad and annoyed at. It is embarrassing but there is nothing better I could think of doing.\n\n                                              Experiencing that situation, we decided to set the fire low between the two of us. That actually means that we will never see each other until everything goes well. So that\u2019s it. Cool-off, whatever it is. It really confused me. Questions run in my mind like bolts of electricity. The question is like, \u201cWhat the hell? Is it over?\u201d  But those thoughts did not come out of my mouth. I just uttered \u201cOkay\u201d, and then we parted ways. We have no declared closure. Up to this moment I am writing this essay, I have no idea how to get on again with him. I do not really have the courage to even send a short text message to make him realize that I terribly miss him.\n\n                                                Right now, I am making things better. I am trying to improve my grades so I will not disappoint my family. I can never really tell the future for us. But for the benefit of it, I am preparing myself when the day comes for our moment of truth. I am helping myself getting through the day although I am missing him so much. I know that when you are missing someone, you should do something on it. Act upon it. But right now, I am not sure of what I am going to do.
