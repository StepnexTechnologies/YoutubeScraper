People make little micromovements, which these avatars don't do. Additionally, digital avatars don't account for things like kinetic energy and gravity when moving around. When we do something like wave, jump, or start walking, our mass takes a moment to get moving from a resting state or when changing direction because it needs to overcome inertia. This should scale based on mass, for example, the acceleration curve should look a lot different for an avatar that starts running than an arm that starts waving. Currently, it breaks the illusion every time a digital human makes a movement that doesn't account for the laws of motion. It's such a subtle thing, but our eyes and brains are well adapted at picking these things out. Until animators and game engines can master inertia, and clean up those mouth movements, we're going to see right through it, though it is definitely getting better, at least until they start moving and running their mouths lol.", "commenter_channel_name": "@vvhitevvabbit6479", "likes": 222, "date": "3 years ago (edited)", "fetched_date": "2025-01-19 14:46:27.962413", "replies_count": null, "liked_by_creator": false}, {"comment": "I love how when the Unreal 5 stuff started playing.
